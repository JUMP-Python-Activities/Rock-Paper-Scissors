# Rock-Paper-Scissors

- Write a program that accepts the user’s input, and make sure that input is either r, p, or s
- Ask for a second user’s input, and make sure that input is also only r, p, or s
- Complete the program so it returns the winner of the game (‘Player 1’, ‘Player 2’, or ‘Tie’)
- The game only needs to run once.
